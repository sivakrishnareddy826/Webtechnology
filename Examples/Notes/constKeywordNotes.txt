The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

Variables defined with const have Block Scope

Cannot be Reassigned
A variable defined with the const keyword cannot be reassigned:
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

Must be Assigned
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
Correct
const PI = 3.14159265359;

InCorrect:
const PI; // error
PI = 3.14159265359; //error

When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp

Constant Objects and Arrays
The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object

What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this.
